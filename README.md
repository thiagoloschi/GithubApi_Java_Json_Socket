# GithubApi_Java_Json_Socket

This is an example of a Webservice application consuming the data requested to the Github API. 

Once a Github's username is entered, the application gets to inform user's full name, location, date of membership, a list of public repositores, a list of followers, with their full name, location and amount of public repositories. 

This application was built in Java, using Json parser to consume API data and a http socket to connect to the url.
